# Lysogenic Propensity in Stressed Environments as a function of Muliplicity of Infection

We are trying to understand the impact of environmental stresses on the coexistence of phage-bacteria systems. A phage-bacteria system can be characterized with the following parameters: 

* phage and bacterial populations (jointly expressed using multiplicity of infection (MoI))
* bacterial growth rate
* phage burst rate
* bacterial degradation rate
* phage degradation rate

Some of the pertinent literature in this area covers:

* the impact of the phage degradation rate on coexistence ([Heilmann et al., (2010)](http://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.02326-09))
* a bet-hedging approach to ensure survival in case of sporadic spikes of degradation rates ([Maslov and Sneppen, (2015)](http://doi.org/10.1038/srep10523))
* the stochasticity in the lysogeny-lysis decision at a higher MoI ([Avlund et al., (2009)](http://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.01057-09))
* a game theoretic approach to investigate the lysogenic propensity for different MoI ([Sinha et al., (2017)](http://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01386))

We are working on expanding our domain to include a range of environmental conditions. One possible use case is to simulate the effect of antibiotics on the coexistence of the populations - how the optimal propensity of lysogeny should change in different stress conditions.

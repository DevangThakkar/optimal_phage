# Lysogenic Propensity in Stressed Environments as a function of Muliplicity of Infection

We are trying to understand the impact of environmental stresses on the coexistence of phage-bacteria systems. A phage-bacteria system can be characterized with the following parameters: 

* multiplicity of infection
* bacterial growth rate
* phage burst rate
* bacterial degradation rate
* phage degradation rate

[Heilmann et al. (2010)](http://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.02326-09) discusses the impact of phage degradation rate on the co-existence of the phage-bacteria population.
